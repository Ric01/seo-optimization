Tips for better hotel experiences while traveling in India:

India offers some of the most magnificent hotel stays for every budget, in most visited locations. World renowned 5 star hotel chains and smaller heritage hotels are easily available. Home stays, budget hotels and guest houses are also becoming the norm nowadays. Kindly ask your travel specialist for options. India is well connected by air, train and road. Advance bookings for air travel and trains are highly recommended.
Always have a photocopy of your passport, visa, travel insurance and driving license on you at all times. It comes in handy if you misplace the originals.
Electric Voltage in India
• Electricity Voltage in India is 220 volts AC, 50 cycles.•Some upscale hotels in India do have provisions for 110 volt shavers, electric tooth brushes etc.•However, it is still a good idea to take along a voltage converter if you have small electrical gadgets that you intend to use during your trip to India.•If possible buy an electric plug adapter as the electric plugs in India are rounded. Such adapters are available for about one dollar in stores such as Radio Shack or most department stores that sell electronic goods


84) It’s also possible to stay at $500, 5 star palaces. If you’re wanting a luxury vacation then India also offers some of the best hotel experiences in the world.
85) Mid range hotels are a balanced blend of comfort and price. The hotels in the $40 to $70 range offer mostly Western standards e.g clean sheets, hot water and a normal toilet. 
88) Remember, only brush your teeth with bottled water. It’s easy to forget, especially if you stay at a fancy hotel but the water everywhere in India is questionable and brushing your teeth is no exception.
91) Tip your staff appropriately. Whenever you get room service of any kind at a hotel I recommend you tip between 10 and 20 rupees. If you’re staying at a more fancy hotel you may want to tip between 30 and 50 rupees. This should will help you get better service and more alert staff.

How to bargain like an Indian:

Travel to India – Shopping
Take your time – There are always many, many vendors for every product. If you’re going to be in town for a few days, say so and take notes of the products, prices and places so that you can go back if you want. 

Chai? – If you show interest, you will likely be offered chai to keep you around. It will be more difficult to say no.
Shipping things home – there are many stores that specialize in shipping your purchases home. Make sure that you get a receipt for your shipment. Word amongst travelers is that the system works well though I didn’t test it.
No compre antigüedades de más de 100 años. La compra y venta de marfil y la vida silvestre es un delito.

Comprar en las tiendas de uso recreativo. El regateo es una práctica popular en la India y también necesaria. Siempre pide la factura o ticket de lo que ha comprado.


97) Look for fixed rate shops if you don’t want to bargain.These shops have the prices already set and are generally fair.
101) Have fun with it. The main thing is to not take things too seriously (especially since your savings may only be few dollars) and enjoy the process. Otherwise it can quickly get very emotionally and physically draining.

Advice specifically for women traveling in India:

123) Dress appropriately and cover up. India is still a very conservative country. Despite the heat and perpetual sweating, make sure to always carry a shawl to cover your shoulders, wear knee length or longer pants along with tops long enough to cover your bottom. Tight fitting clothing will solicit unwanted attention and is considered disrespectful at sacred sites and temples.
125) Avoid going out after dark. We don’t recommend heading out on your own after dark unless you have a buddy or group to explore with. You will notice there are not many local women out after the early evening.
126) Travel with a group. If it’s your first trip then definitely consider traveling to India with a group. 
128) Seriously, put a ring on it. When locals find out you aren’t married, be prepared for a lot of (usually disapproving) feedback. I often wear a simple band around my finger just to keep unwanted questions and interest at bay. If you are already married then you’ve got it made.

130) India has the second largest population in the world. According to the 2011 census it is now over 1.2 billion and growing incredibly fast. It is the 31st most densely populated nation with 991 people per square mile. Some sources say it’s the oldest continuous civilization on the planet.
131) India is the world’s largest democracy. It became independant of the British occupation in 1947 and is considered a “Federal parliamentary constitutional republic”.
132) There are over 17 languages. Sanskrit is the most ancient known language and is the mother of all the European languages. Luckily for us, English is spoken almost everywhere (making it the largest English speaking country in the world). The number of distinctly different languages highlights the fact that India is extremely culturally diverse and in many ways like a collection of countries rather than one country. Where ever you visit, it’s helpful to learn a few phrases of the local language.
133) The predominant religion is Hinduism at over 78%. Below is pie chart based off the 2011 census showing the spread of popular religions in India. Even though Christianity is only 2.5% there are over 30 million Christians in India!

135) The railway system is vast. One of the best ways to get around India (apart from flying) is on their trains. They were setup originally by the British in 1853. The Indian Railways employs about 1.5 million people making it one of the largest employers in the world. And, 18 million people per day travel on these trains.
138) Cricket is by far the most popular sport. For those who don’t know, it’s similar to baseball and in almost every field you pass in India you’ll see kids (and adults) playing the sport.

Good cultural differences
139) Guest is God. In India it is an honor to have a guest, doubly so if it’s a foreigner. This is because they have a beautiful proverb that says “Atithidevo Bhava (अतिथिदेवो भव)” which means “the guest is equivalent to God”. For this reason there’s a good chance you’ll be invited to someone’s home. In this case it is nice to send a gift to India to your host when you get home.
141) Spirituality and religion thrives. Upon every street corner is some statue or place of worship. The history and power of the land is so strong and sometimes over powering and it is the mecca for mass yoga and meditation.
142) Indian’s try to offer amazing service. India is known for being a “service oriented culture” and everyone works hard to please. India has a lot of people and time on it’s hands making it possible to hire someone to do practically anything. Sometimes the quality of the service may not be ideal but the effort is almost always there.
143) Exquisite color creates eye candy everywhere. Indian’s love color. Whether it’s the clothing, the food or the houses, everywhere you look, you will be overwhelmed by beautiful arrays of color.
144) The resourcefulness and ingenuity is mind blowing.While driving the streets you will find the most eye opening resourcefulness. From people carrying a bed frame or sheet of glass on the back of a motorcycle to a truck so over laden with goods that the driver can barely see out the front window. This no doubt stems from the poverty and need to survive.
145) India is a mostly peaceful nation. In fact, India has never invaded another country in at least 1000 years. Although India itself has been invaded countless times by other countries. Crime rate is lower than in the U.S and if you avoid big cities you will feel very safe.
146) Some of the best food in the world. It of course depends on your taste but the unbelievable diversity of flavors and textures, colors and presentation of the food can be a divine experience. Many dishes take hours upon hours to prepare and if you have a sweet tooth you won’t be disappointed.
